# Cat Modelling & Risk Analysis — Europe (1990–2024)

Short project: exploratory catastrophe (CAT) analysis using EM-DAT data for Europe & the UK.
This repo includes:
- `data/` — raw EM-DAT export and cleaned dataset used for analysis
- `analysis/` — Excel workbook with PivotTables & calculations
- `charts/` — final charts exported as PNG
- `report/` — short project report (Word/PDF)
- `cover/` — LinkedIn cover image

## Key findings (summary)
- Storms and floods contribute the largest share of economic losses across Europe.
- Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, and the UK show the highest total damages.
- Adjusted damages have increased over time, indicating rising exposure.

## How I worked
1. Clean data in Excel (removed duplicates, fixed numeric formats).  
2. Aggregated damage using PivotTables by disaster type, year, and country.  
3. Exported charts (bar, line); used log scale for country comparison.  
4. Compiled findings in `European_Disaster_Trends_Analysis` and shared workbook in `public_emdat_custom_request_2025-10-10_f1614555-f903-41db-b87f-8469b2c17cf2(AutoRecovered)`.
